# GitHub Scala API Project

This project is a RESTful API built with the Play Framework in Scala. It interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve and display information about repositories, including the top 5 most popular Scala repositories. The API also includes basic CRUD operations for managing users stored in MongoDB, allowing you to fetch, create, update, and delete users.

## Running the project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. clone the repository and navigate into the project directory, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arei1997/GitHubScalaProject.git
cd GitHubScalaProject
```

2. Set up MongoDB:

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine. Adjust the MongoDB connection settings in the application.conf file if necessary.

3. Set up the GitHub API Token:

You'll need to add your GitHub personal access token to the project's configuration. Update the application.conf file with your token:
```bash
github.token = "your-github-personal-access-token"
```
